# Data-Projects
Compilation of the Data Projects I'm going to implement, with Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Visualizations in my free time.

The requirements for running it locally are:

- Having installed Python3
- Having installed Anaconda for Jupyter Lab
- Having installed the packages of every project (pip install)
- Having installed the visualization program (mostly free programmes)

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
